				<h1>IPO Preview</h1>

				<div class="title">Is the Renewable Industry Renewable?</div>
				<div class="post">Based in Ames, Iowa, Renewable Energy Group,
					(REGI), scheduled, as the first initial public offering of 2012, a
					$100 million IPO with a market capitalization of $401 million at a
					price range mid-point of $14 for today, Thursday, January 19, 2011.
					REGI priced last night (January 18) at $10, 28% below mid-range &
					now trades flat. http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=regi&ql=1 The stock
					opened on the Nasdaq at $10.10, 1% above its target offering of
					$10.00. A total of 7.2 million shares were sold, at prices well
					below the expected mid-point range of $13-$15 per share. REGI's
					outlook depends on politics, because - in our opinion - biodiesel
					without mandates and subsidies is not a viable market. So we are
					neutral on REGI at $10 today.</div>
